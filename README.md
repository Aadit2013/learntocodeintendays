this is my 4th repositartry and i am learning how to code and my dad told me 

## hello.py

A simple Python program that takes a name and a count as input, then prints a message saying that person is cool!

### How to use:

**Interactive mode (prompts for input):**
```bash
python hello.py
```
You'll be asked to enter a name and how many times to print the message.

**Command-line arguments:**
```bash
python hello.py aadit 5
```
This prints "aadit is cool" 5 times.

**With decimal/float input:**
The program accepts float inputs for the count. For example:
```bash
python hello.py john 2.5
```
This prints "john is cool" 2 times (the decimal is rounded down).
